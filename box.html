                <h3>Clueless</h3>
                <p>Clueless, is what I am today<br>
                    Don’t know if anybody is going to stay<br>
                    Or just run away<br>
                    Like many of the others did<br>
                    This anxiety is too much to take<br>
                    I’m scared; I might reach the threshold value too soon<br>
                     Though I’m strong right now, there are more chances for me to break

                <p>I’m so sick of one particular phrase,<br>
                    ‘Log kya kahenge?’<br>
                    Why do I even need to think<br>
                    About what others are thinking?<br>
                    How much hell of a time would I waste?<br>
                    If I only cared that much?<br>
                    How would I then grow?<br>
                    How would I be unique and have my magical touch?</p><br>

                            Those twinkling eyes<br>
                            Closing and opening.<br>
                            Those innocent blinks<br>
                            Giving me unexpected winks,<br>
                            You just sweep me off my feet<br>
                            Like a true prince<br>
                            You make me drench in your unconditional love<br>
                            Till I completely sink.<br>
                            You wouldn’t let me go<br>
                            Always sitting by my side

                        <p>It is unnecessary for the devil,<br>
                            To know how you feel.<br>
                            Your gut says something but your brain<br>
                            Says something else.<br>
                            How can I ever explain my trivial feelings?<br>
                            Do you even know how cloudy my judgment has become?<br>
                            How should I explain this to anyone?
